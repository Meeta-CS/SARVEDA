**Problem Statement/Opportunity:**

The major problem is people have no work and they are unemployed. So this platform for learners with an opportunity to learn the in-demand technology skills and work, courses for free so they will read and learn them. It solves the problem of unemployment because after learning the skills they open their own work and do something for them and others.

The problem which we are forgetting is divided into 4 categories:
**Junior Levels:**  Students who are fresh to the school end. Teaching process starting from 5th to 10th all the students will be targeted under this.
**Secondary Level:**  Students who are going to be in the heigher level of school this platform can help them in choosing the correct stream based on the skills & interest.
**High Level:**  CAT, XAT, JEE, PRE MAINS this plaform can hellp students in preparing in these minimalistic price range.
**Competative Exam:**  This wil give a wider range as well as opportunity for the Tier2, Tier3 cities, so the students from these areas will be getting a proper opportunity to compete without finding heavy on the pocket.

**Project Description:**

The twpo m=ajor factors in which we are working:

1. **Pricing:** To reduce the pricing as amuch as possible so it can benefit a wast number of students.
2. **One-Stop Solution:**  We want to creat a platform there any student can get education starting from till the time they are onboard.


I can take this idea from FutureReadyTalent Internship who gaves the opportunity to learn and gain many skills through this program. Its give me a platform to explore new technologies. So, I am building a platform or a website where every student can learn any skill like technical field, musicians, about agriculture and more. It has a home page, about us page, course page, learning path, and contact us page.
